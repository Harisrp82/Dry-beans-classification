# Dry beans classification
This repository contains machine learning models developed to classify seven distinct types of dry beans using a dataset of 13,611 images. Classifying these beans accurately is a challenge due to the similarities and complexities within the dataset. However, we've achieved significant accuracy with thorough data preprocessing and model optimization.
